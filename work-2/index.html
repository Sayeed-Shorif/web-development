                <p>
                <nav class="name">Gin</nav> possesses green eyes, pale skin & silver hair. Initially, he covers his face
                with a traditional Japanese yokai mask. However, he becomes comfortable in taking it off when Hotaru is
                present. As Hotaru grows, Gin's appearance remained almost the same because he ages a quarter slower
                than a
                normal human</p>

                <p>
                <nav class="name">Gin</nav> has a very na√Øve personality, mostly because he never had any kind of
                relationship
                besides with the forest spirits and Hotaru. He usually has a calm demeanor, and is also sweet and kind,
                especially as he warms up to Hotaru over the years of knowing her.</p>

            <h3 class="border">Plot </h3>
            <p>At the beginning, Gin was abandoned by his parents and left in the Spirit Forest, where the other spirits
                took him in and gave him the mask he wears to this day. Since then, Gin lived in solitary with only his
                fellow spirits as his company- that is, until Hotaru came and got lost in the forest. After meeting
                Hotaru,
                Gin looked forward to every day in the summer as he would spend time with his new found friend.</p>

                    <h4 class="main-sub">Meeting with Hotaru</h4>
                    <p>Little Hotaru is lost in the forest during the summer when visiting her Uncle's home. Alone and
                        frightened, she cries, attracting Gin's attention. Gin helped Hotaru out of the forest to search
                        for
                        her
                        Uncle's house.</p>

                    <h4>Waiting for Summer</h4>
                    <p>
                        Hotaru can only meet Gin during the summer, when she stays at her Uncle's house. During the
                        other
                        seasons, Hotaru has to move back to her original home away from the forest. Gin waits for summer
                        to
                        come
                        as well as Hotaru, as it is the only time the two can be together. Hotaru always comes back to
                        the
                        forest every summer to visit Gin without fail. Their bond grow stronger and they grow closer
                        with
                        each
                        passing summer.

                    <h4>A Precious Hug</h4>
                    <p>
                        <nav class="name">Gin</nav> takes Hotaru to the Yokai Festival of Spirits where they are walking together when a human
                        boy
                        who
                        snuck into the festival rushes by. He trips and nearly falls. Gin catches him by his arm and
                        prevents
                        the fall. In the process Gin touches the boy. The magic which preserves Gin's body is
                        obliterated
                        due to
                        the contact and Gin starts to disintegrate into glowing shards. Knowing that he has mere minutes
                        to
                        live, Gin calls Hotaru to him. Hotaru rushes into his arms, getting the chance to finally touch
                        him.
                        They embrace briefly, both just happy to be in each others' arms. Until Gin dissolves into light
                        particles and Hotaru is left hugging the yukata that he was wearing as she falls to the ground,
                        crying.
                        Gin admits his love for Hotaru and she admits that she loves him too. A Yokai that knew Gin
                        thanked
                        her
                        because she gave Gin happiness and fulfilled his wish, which was to touch a human. Hotaru keeps
                        his
                        mask
                        which serves as a reminder of Gin's existence, and kissed it.
